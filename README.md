# General

When your aplication becomes a bit messy and you have a lot of points of entry to it with many sources of truth - maybe it is time to think about pushing you business logic to PostgreSQL?

During my talk I am not trying to convince you to stop using ORM at all. This is more like a showing the "other side" of truth if we think about data processing with python and database.
